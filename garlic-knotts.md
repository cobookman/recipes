# Garlic Knotts

**Makes:** ~24 garlic knotts

**Total Time:** ~30mins with + ~2 hours for pizza dough

## Ingredients:
* Pizza Dough
* Half a head of Garlic
* Stick of Butter
* Parmesian
* Salt/Pepper/crushed red pepper
* (OPTIONAL) Parsley

## Instructions
1. Make the pizza dough described in this recipe https://github.com/cobookman/recipes/blob/master/pizza-dough.md

2. Stretch pizza dough into a semi-thick rectangle, see this YT video for visuals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcQfyimnF7E

3. Coat your hands in oil then Divide pizza dough into thin strips. Then tie them into a knott, and directly place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

4. Let the garlic knotts rest, uncovered (oil coating from hands, transfers to dough, and prevents dough from drying out). 

5. Turn oven up to 400 F, and once pre-heated or ~30mins passes, cook for 20 minutes until golden brown

6. While knotts are cooking melt the butter under medium/medium-high heat, then add a half head of minced garlic, and a pinch of salt, a pinch of peper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Once garlic is in, turn heat off, and stir and set aside.

7. Take finished knotts and garlic-butter, and mix with a boll. Let slightly cool then add parmesian and fresh parsley (optional) for garnish.
