# Potato Kugel (Kosher for Passover)


## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup neutral oil, such-as vegetable, grapeseed, or shmaltz. Plust a tad extra for greasing the dish
* 5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed
* 2 large yellow onions (1 1/2lb total), halved
* 6 large eggs
* 1/4 cup (scant 1 1/2 ounces/45 grams) potato startch
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt (~2.8 grams)
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* Chopped fresh chives for garnish (Optional)


## Directions

1) Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
Generously grease the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with oil.

2) Using a food processor fitted with a coarse shredding disk, grate the potatoes and onions.
(You may need to cut both into large chunks to fit them into the opening.) Remove the food processor
lid and pick out any stray chunks of potato and/or onion that may not have gotten shredded
and save them for another use. (Alternatively, you can grate the potatoes and onions on
the coarse side of a box grater.)

3) Transfer the vegetables to a large colander. Working in batches,
transfer some of the potato-onion mixture to a large piece of cheesecloth
set over a cutting board, and wring out excess liquid into a medium bowl.
Transfer the wrung out vegetables to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining
potatoes and onions.

4) Let the squeezed out liquid sit undisturbed until the starch settles in the bottom of the bowl.
Then, gently tilt the bowl with the potato liquid to drain out the water; you should see a white
layer of potato starch at the bottom.

5) In the bowl with the residual potato starch, add the eggs, the additional potato starch, oil, salt
and pepper, and whisk. Add the mixture to the shredded vegetables and, using your hands, stir well
to fully combine.

6) Place the prepared baking dish in the oven for about 10 minutes. Carefully remove the dish
from the oven and spoon the kugel mixture into it — the mixture should sizzle on contact.
Gently pat the mixture so it’s evenly distributed and return the dish to the oven. Bake for
about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the kugel is deep golden brown on top and bubbling in places.

NOTES: During Passover, observant Ashkenazi Jews avoid canola, soybean, sunflower, peanut and
corn among other oils that are considered kitniyot — a category of foods restricted during the
holiday. Neutral oils such as safflower and grapeseed can be used. Olive oil is also permitted on
Passover, but its flavor might be too strong here.

Diamond Crystal Kosher salt is used
