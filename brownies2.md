* 1 Â¼ cups (250 grams) granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, natural or Dutch-process
* 1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt, use slightly less if using fine sea or table salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 large cold eggs
* 1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour

## Recipe

* Preheat oven to 325 F & line 8x8 square pan (2 quarts) with parchment paper

* Combine butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest on top of simmering water.
  Stir until butter is melted, and mixture is quite warm. 
  Don't worry if it looks gritty, it'll become smooth once eggs & flour added
* Remove bowl from heat, and set aside for 3 to 5 minutes until it's warm to the touch. 
  Stir in the vanilla with a spoon. Then add eggs one at a time while stirring vigorously after each egg is added.
* After batter looks thick and well blended, sift in flour and stir until fully incorporated. 
* Continue beating with wooden spoon for 40-50 strokes. Keep beating until the batter pulls away from the sides of the bow.
* Spread evenly into the 8x8 square pan, and bake for **20 to 25 minutes**.
  Keep baking until a toothpick can be incerted and come out with a few moist crubms.
* Cool completly then remove from pan and cut into ~16 squares.
