# Falafel

Original recipe: https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/air_fryer_falafel/

Makes: ~25-30 falafel discs

## Ingredients:
* 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley
* 1/4 cup cilantro
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 large shallot, chopped (or half a medium onion)
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 lemon, juice only
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Spray olive oil, for cooking


## Directions:

1) In the bowl of a food processor, add all the ingredients (chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, garlic,
   shallot, flour, sesame seeds, cumin, paprika, lemon, and salt). **Pulse** until mixture comes
   together in a rough paste. It shouldn’t be completely smooth.
   
2) Shape the falafel mixture into tablespoon-sized discs, about 1-inch in diameter.
   Repeat until you use all the falafel mixture. You should get 25 to 30 falafel discs.
   
3) Spray the basket for your air fryer with some nonstick olive oil. Add as many falafel discs
   into the basket as you can without them touching and spray them with olive oil very lightly.
   Air fry the falafel at 350°F ̊ for 8 minutes. Flip and fry for another 6 minutes on the second side.
