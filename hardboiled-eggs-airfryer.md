# Hardboiled Eggs in an Airfryer

Makes the easiest to peel hardboiled eggs, and is way less effort.

# Steps
* Place eggs on wire-rack in the airfryer. Set airfryer to 250 F, and run for 16 mins. 
* After airfryer is done take the eggs out and put in cool water-bath for soft-boiled, or leave out if wanting a generic hardboiled egg.


Timing & temp tested with eggs right out the fridge, and no pre-heating of airfryer.
