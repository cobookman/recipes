# Salsa Verde / Avacado Salsa

## Ingredients 
Recipe scales up/down proportionately. 

* 1 ½ pounds tomatillos (about 12 medium), husked and rinsed
* 1 to 2 medium jalapeños (leave seeds for medium-Spicey. Deseed for mild. 
Add more jalapeños for Spicer salsa)
* ¼ cup packed fresh cilantro leaves (more if you love cilantro)
* 1 limes worth of juice. Roughly 2 tablespoons to ¼ cup lime juice
* ½ to 1 teaspoon salt, to taste
* Optional variation: 1 to 2 diced avocados, for creamy avocado salsa verde


# Instructions 

INSTRUCTIONS

* Preheat the broiler with a rack 
about 4 inches below the heat source. 
Place the tomatillos and jalapeño(s) 
on a rimmed baking sheet and broil 
until they’re blackened in spots, 
about 5 minutes.

* Remove the baking sheet from 
the oven, carefully flip over the
tomatillos and pepper(s) with tongs
and broil for 4 to 6 more minutes,
until the tomatillos are
splotchy-black and blistered.

* Meanwhile, in a food processor or 
blender, combine the chopped onion, 
cilantro, 2 tablespoons lime 
juice and ½ teaspoon salt. 

* Once the tomatillos are out
of the oven, carefully transfer
the hot tomatillos, pepper(s) and
all of their juices into the food
processor or blender.

* Pulse until the mixture is mostly
smooth and no big chunks of tomatillo
remain, scraping down the sides
as necessary. Season to taste
with additional lime juice and
salt, if desired.

* The salsa will be thinner at
first, but will thicken up after
a few hours in the refrigerator,
due to the naturally occurring
pectin in the tomatillos.

* If you’d like to make creamy
avocado salsa verde, let the
salsa cool down before blending
in 1 to 2 diced avocados
(the more avocado, the creamier
it gets).
