## Ingredients

* 1 small garlic clove minced
* 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup tahini (or sub 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil + a tad less than 1/4 cup sesame seeds)
* 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1-2 lemons
* 2 whole red bell peppers
* 1 can chickpeas (~15 oz)

### Roasting Peppers
* Turn on broiler to 500F or highest & move top oven rack to ~5inches from brioler.
* Cut peppers into large flat pieces, place skin-side up on baking sheet lined with foil
* Broil for 5-10mins until skin charred. Then take out of oven.

### Hummus
* Add garlic cloves, olive oil, cumin, salt, and tahini to blender. Blend on high until well mixed (~30sec)
* Open, drain, and rinse chickpeas. Add them to the blender and mix on high until well mixed (~30sec). You might need to use the plunger.
* Take the skins off the roasted red peppers. Save 2-3 pieces and put the rest in the blender. Blend on high again until well mixed (~20sec)
* If consistency is too chunky, add water or additional oil to smooth out.
* Chop 2-3 red peppers into small chunks. Empty blender into bowl. Place chopped red peppers on top of hummus.
