Original - https://www.womansday.com/food-recipes/food-drinks/a29845554/moroccan-meatballs-with-roasted-tomatoes-and-chickpeas-recipe/


## Ingredients
* 1 large egg
* 1/3 c. panko
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 1/4 tsp. ground allspice (A-ok to leave out, still tastes great!)
* 1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon
* Kosher salt and pepper
* 3 cloves garlic, divided
* 1 lb. ground beef
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 14.5-oz can chickpeas, rinsed
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 1/4 c. crumbled feta
* 1/4 c. cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
* Couscous, for serving


## Instructions

1. Heat broiler. In a large bowl, beat egg, then add panko, spices, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper. Finely grate in 2 cloves garlic. Mix in beef, then shape into 12 balls.

2. Transfer meatballs to a rimmed baking sheet, then broil on a rack in the upper portion of the oven until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 425Â°F. Remove meatballs from oven and carefully pour out any excess fat.

3. In a bowl, toss tomatoes and chickpeas with oil, remaining clove garlic (thinly sliced), and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Add to pan with meatballs and roast until tomatoes have softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, top with feta and parsley, and serve with couscous.
