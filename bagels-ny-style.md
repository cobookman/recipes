# Bagels NY Style

**Makes:** 8 medium-sized bagels

**Total Time:** 2 hours


## Ingredients:
* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1 ½ tablespoons (4 ½ teaspoons) granulated sugar
* 1 ¼ cups / 300ml warm water 
* 3 ½ cups (500g) bread flour or high gluten flour
* 1 ½ teaspoons salt
* Egg Wash: 1 egg + 1 splash of water (~1 teaspon)

## Instructions
1. Warm up 1/2 a cup of water (Microwave 15-30sec). Pour in sugar & Yeast. Let it sit for five minutes then stir.

2. Mix flour & salt in bowl, and make a well in the center.

3. Warm up 3/4 a cup of water (Microwave ~30sec). Pour all wet ingredients into bowl & mix/knead for 10 minutes until smooth & elastic.. Add water as needed to get dough to be moist, firm, and stiff after kneading.

4. Lightly brush a large bowl with a oil. Turn dough to coat and cover with damp towel.

5. Let dough rise for 1 hour until doubles.

6. Punch the dough down, and let rest for another 10 minutes.

7. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape into ball.

8. Press finger into center of each dough ball, and form a ring. Stretch until center fits about a quarter.

9. Let dough rest for 10 minutes. Cover with damp towel.

10. Preheat oven to 425ºF and bring large pot of water to boil.

11. Reduce water heat, and lower bagels into the water. Avoid crowding. Give each side 1.5 minutes. Change to 2 minutes per side for a chewier bagel. Once done use slotted spatula to move to a baking pan.

12. Create an egg wash by whisking an egg and a splash of water. Egg wash the bagels, then add toppings. Be sure not to get bottom of bagels covered with egg wash as it'll burn.

13. Place bagels onto oiled baking sheet. Place in oven for 20 minutes, until golden brown.

14. Cool on wire rack.
