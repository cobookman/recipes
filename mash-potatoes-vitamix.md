# Mash Potatoes using a Vitamix
Differs slighty from vitamix's own recipe: https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/recipes/mashed-potatoes

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds (820 g) russet potatoes, peeled, quartered
* 1 cup (240 ml) heavy whipping cream
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter
* 2 teaspoons salt, optional, extra salt is needed for boiling the potatoes

## Instructions
1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add 1/4 cup (30g) of salt, optional, and place over medium heat. 
   Simmer until fork tender, about an half hour (do not boil, or the potatoes will fall apart and get water logged).
2. While the potatoes are cooking, combine the butter, milk and 2 teaspoon (10g) of salt. Microwave for 30sec-1min until butter is fully melted
3. Once the potatoes are fork tender, strain and place back into the large pot. Place back on stovetop over low heat and cook again for 1 to 2 minutes 
   (this will help to release any extra moisture in the potatoes from the cooking process).
3. Place the warm milk mixture then the potatoes into the Vitamix container and secure the lid. Select Variable 3 and begin to pulse. 
   Remove the lid plug and insert the tamper, using it to push ingredients down into the blades. Pulse 18-20 times, or until the 
   mixture is smooth (be careful not to over mix, or the potatoes will get gummy and starchy.
4. Serve warm.
