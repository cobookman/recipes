# Chocolate Date Balls

Adapted from: https://www.cottercrunch.com/dark-chocolate-chewy-energy-bites-blender/


## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup chocolate (semi-sweet, ideally guittard)
* 1 cup raw almonds (unsalted & un-roasted)
* 5 to 6 oz of pitted medjool dates (buy ones with pits, they taste better). 


## Directions
* Add ingredients to blender
* Blend until well mixed. If using a vitamix leave on high for a half a minute with tamper. Chocolate will eventually melt and it'll come together.
* Roll into 18 small balls (tad bigger than size of quarter), and place onto wax or parchment paper.
* Freeze for 30mins
* Take out of freezer, put in ziplock bag. Store in fridge for up to 8 weeks.
