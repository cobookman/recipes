Adapted from: https://www.cottercrunch.com/dark-chocolate-chewy-energy-bites-blender/


## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup chocolate (semi-sweet, ideally guittard)
* 1 cup raw almonds (unsalted & un-roasted)
* 5 to 6 oz of pitted medjool dates (buy ones with pits, they taste better). 
* ~4 tbps of cocoa powder
* ~2 tspn of kosher salt

## Directions
* Add chocolate, almonds, pitted dates to blender
* Blend until well mixed. If using a vitamix leave on high for a half a minute with tamper. Chocolate will eventually melt and it'll come together.

* Mix cocoa powder and salt into ramikin or small bowl, and coat each ball by rolling it around in mixture. Put back on wax or parchment paper.
* Freeze for 30mins
* Take out of freezer, put in ziplock bag. Store in fridge for up to 8 weeks.
